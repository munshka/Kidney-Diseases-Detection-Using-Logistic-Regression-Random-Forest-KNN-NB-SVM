# Kidney Diseases Detection

This repository contains a kidney diseases detection project using a dataset that includes various attributes, such as BMI, Age Category, Diabetic status, General Health, Sleep Time, and the presence or absence of Kidney Disease. We apply several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree, to predict the likelihood of kidney disease.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Age Category**: Categorized age group (e.g., 65-69)
- **Diabetic**: Diabetic status (Yes/No)
- **GenHealth**: General Health status (e.g., Very good)
- **Sleep Time**: Hours of sleep
- **KidneyDisease**: Target variable indicating the presence (Yes) or absence (No) of Kidney Disease.

## Algorithms

We employ the following machine learning algorithms for kidney disease prediction:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear classification model that is well-suited for binary classification problems like this one.

2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.

4. **Naive Bayes (NB)**: A probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem to classify data.

5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification technique that finds the best hyperplane to separate different classes.

6. **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets based on attributes.
